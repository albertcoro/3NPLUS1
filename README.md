# 3NPLUS1
The 3n+1 problem

<h3>What is this project?</h3>

This is a famous mathematics problem in witch we grab a random number at will and we apply it some simple rules: 
if it's odd we multiply it by 3 and we add 1, if it's even we divide it by two. Once we get the result we keep on applying these rules
until we get to a bucle 4 goes to 2 goes to 1 and back to 4.
