<h3>What is this project?</h3>

This is a famous mathematics problem in witch we grab a random number at will and we apply it some simple rules: 
if it's odd we multiply it by 3 and we add 1, if it's even we divide it by two. Once we get the result we keep on applying these rules
until we get to a bucle 4 goes to 2 goes to 1 and back to 4.

<h3>What the motivation behind it?</h3>

I enjoy applying my knowledge of computer science and mathematics to challenge myself in small programming puzzles such as this one, thinking
about how it potentially could be solved, what data structures should I use to maximize efficiency, etc.

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

I have learned a bit about python datasctrucures and algorithms. I have also learned a bit about the library I used pyplot. Certenly I haven't used
its full potential, not even close to that. But I've learn a fair bit about it while I was digging throught the documentation.
